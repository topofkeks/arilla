ARILLA BEST PRACTICES:
Single bit const signals should not be named '0' and '1', they should be named zero and one instead
Signals should not be named IN or OUT, its recommended to use I and O or input and output
Identifiers must begin with a letter and should end with a letter (ending with a digit is allowed but discouraged)
When generating components: generate them in components folder from components project and make sure they are included in components project
Generate megafunctions using VHDL and only generate required files (.vhd and .bsf)
Microcode .mif files should be placed in mic folder while .vhd async ROM files belong in folder of the project in which they are used
Feel free to resurrect asm folder for .asm and machine code .mif files
